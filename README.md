# Languages ðŸ“š

A set of simple guides/walkthroughs for popular programming languages - primarily focused on practical tasks (eg: imports, requests, etc).

## Installation

Each language subdirectory has their own installation instructions - you can ignore this if you already have your environment set up for a given language.

## Usage

Refer to subdirectories for usage instructions.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Typically this might come about when a language is updated/major changes occur and the guides need to be updated.
